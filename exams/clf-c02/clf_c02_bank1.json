      "option_d": "EC2 has a flexible, pay-as-you-go pricing model",
      "option_e": "EC2 has automatic storage cost optimization",
      "explanation": "Some of the advantages of using Amazon EC2 instances to host applications in the AWS Cloud instead of on premises are: EC2 integrates with Amazon VPC, AWS CloudTrail, and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Amazon VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. AWS CloudTrail enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. AWS IAM enables you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely. Therefore, the correct answer is B. You can learn more about Amazon EC2 and its integration with other AWS services EC2 has a flexible, pay-as-you-go pricing model. You only pay for the compute capacity you use, and you can scale up and down as needed. You can also choose from different pricing options, such as On-Demand, Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances, to optimize your costs. Therefore, the correct answer is D. You can learn more about Amazon EC2 pricing The other options are incorrect because: EC2 does not include operating system patch management. You are responsible for managing and maintaining your own operating systems on EC2 instances. You can use AWS Systems Manager to automate common maintenance tasks, such as applying patches, or use Amazon EC2 Image Builder to create and maintain secure images. Therefore, the incorrect answer is A. EC2 does not have a 100% service level agreement (SLA). The EC2 SLA guarantees 99.99% availability for each EC2 Region, not for each individual instance. Therefore, the incorrect answer is C. EC2 does not have automatic storage cost optimization. You are responsible for choosing the right storage option for your EC2 instances, such as Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) or Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), and monitoring and optimizing your storage costs. You can use AWS Cost Explorer or AWS Trusted Advisor to analyze and reduce your storage spending. Therefore, the incorrect answer is E"

      "option_c": "AWS Trusted Advisor",
      "option_d": "AWS Budgets",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is C because AWS Trusted Advisor is an AWS service or tool that provides users with the ability to monitor AWS service quotas. AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides users with real-time guidance to help them provision their resources following AWS best practices. One of the categories of checks that AWS Trusted Advisor performs is service limits, which monitors the usage of each AWS service and alerts users when they are close to reaching the default limit. The other options are incorrect because they are not AWS services or tools that provide users with the ability to monitor AWS service quotas. AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables users to track user activity and API usage across their AWS account.

      "option_a": "Trade security for elasticity",
      "option_b": "Trade operational excellence for agility",
      "option_c": "Trade fixed expenses for variable expenses",
      "option_d": "Trade elasticity for performance",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is C because AWS Cloud computing allows customers to trade fixed expenses for variable expenses. This means that customers only pay for the resources they use, and can scale up or down as needed. The other options are incorrect because they are not advantages of AWS Cloud computing. Trade security for elasticity means that customers have to compromise on the protection of their data and applications in order to adjust their capacity quickly. Trade operational excellence for agility means that customers have to sacrifice the quality and reliability of their operations in order to respond to changing needs faster. Trade elasticity for performance means that customers have to limit their ability to scale up or down in order to achieve higher speed and efficiency. Reference: What is Cloud Computing?"

      "question": "A company is running applications on Amazon EC2 instances in the same AWS account for several different projects. The company wants to track the infrastructure costs for each of the projects separately. The company must conduct this tracking with the least possible impact to the existing infrastructure and with no additional cost. What should the company do to meet these requirements?",
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "option_a": "Use a different EC2 instance type for each project",
      "option_b": "Publish project-specific custom Amazon CloudWatch metrics for each application",
      "option_c": "Deploy EC2 instances for each project in a separate AWS account",
      "option_d": "Use cost allocation tags with values that are specific to each project",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is D because cost allocation tags are a way to track the infrastructure costs for each of the projects separately. Cost allocation tags are key-value pairs that can be attached to AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, and used to categorize and group them for billing purposes. The other options are incorrect because they do not meet the requirements of the question. Use a different EC2 instance type for each project does not help to track the costs for each project, and may impact the performance and compatibility of the applications. Publish project-specific custom Amazon CloudWatch metrics for each application does not help to track the costs for each project, and may incur additional charges for using CloudWatch. Deploy EC2 instances for each project in a separate AWS account does help to track the costs for each project, but it impacts the existing infrastructure and incurs additional charges for using multiple accounts.

Spot Instances are spare EC2 instances that are available at up to 90% discount compared to On-Demand prices. Spot Instances are suitable for stateless, fault-tolerant, and flexible applications that can run for any duration. The other options are incorrect because they do not enable the company to optimize costs and meet the requirements. Reserved Instances are EC2 instances that are reserved for a specific period of time (one or three years) in exchange for a lower hourly rate. Reserved Instances are suitable for steady-state or predictable workloads that run for a long duration. On-Demand Instances are EC2 instances that are launched and billed at a fixed hourly rate. On-Demand Instances are suitable for short-term, irregular, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted. Dedicated Instances are EC2 instances that run on hardware that is dedicated to a single customer. Dedicated Instances are suitable for workloads that require regulatory compliance or data isolation.
