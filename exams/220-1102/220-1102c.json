      "question_number": 194,
      "question": "A technician needs to provide recommendations about how to upgrade backup solutions for a site in an area that has frequent hurricanes and an unstable power grid. Which of the following should the technician recommend implementing?",
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "option_a": "High availability",
      "option_b": "Regionally diverse backups",
      "option_c": "On-site backups",
      "option_d": "Incremental backups",
      "explanation": "Regionally diverse backups are backups that are stored in different geographic locations, preferably far away from the primary site1. This way, if a disaster such as a hurricane or a power outage affects one location, the backups in another location will still be available and accessible2. Regionally diverse backups can help ensure business continuity and data recovery in case of a disaster3. The other options are not the best backup solutions for a site in an area that has frequent hurricanes and an unstable power grid. High availability is a feature that allows a system to remain operational and accessible even if one or more components fail, but it does not protect against data loss or corruption4. On-site backups are backups that are stored in the same location as the primary site, which means they are vulnerable to the same disasters that can affect the primary site. Incremental backups are backups that only store the changes made since the last backup, which means they require less storage space and bandwidth, but they also depend on previous backups to restore data and may not be sufficient for disaster recovery."

      "question_number": 197,
      "question": "A technician is upgrading the backup system for documents at a high-volume law firm. The current backup system can retain no more than three versions of full backups before failing. The law firm is not concerned about restore times but asks the technician to retain more versions when possible. Which of the following backup methods should the technician MOST likely implement?",
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "option_a": "Full",
      "option_b": "Mirror",
      "option_c": "Incremental",
      "option_d": "Differential",
      "explanation": "Incremental backup is a backup method that only backs up the files that have changed since the last backup, whether it was a full or an incremental backup. Incremental backup can save storage space and bandwidth, as it does not copy the same files over and over again. Incremental backup can also retain more versions of backups, as it only stores the changes made to the files. However, incremental backup can have longer restore times, as it requires restoring the last full backup and all the subsequent incremental backups in order to recover the data. The law firm is not concerned about restore times but asks the technician to retain more versions when possible, so incremental backup would be a suitable choice for them."

      "question": "A technician receives a call from a user who is unable to open Outlook. The user states that Outlook worked fine yesterday, but the computer may have restarted sometime overnight. Which of the following is the MOST likely reason Outlook has stopped functioning?",
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "option_a": "Spam filter installation",
      "option_b": "Invalid registry settings",
      "option_c": "Malware infection",
      "option_d": "Operating system update",
      "explanation": "Operating system updates can sometimes cause compatibility issues with some applications, such as Outlook, that may prevent them from opening or working properly. This can happen if the update changes some system files or settings that Outlook relies on, or if the update conflicts with some Outlook add-ins or extensions. To fix this, the technician can try some of these troubleshooting steps: Start Outlook in safe mode and disable add-ins. Safe mode is a way of starting Outlook without any add-ins or extensions that may interfere with its functionality. To start Outlook in safe mode, press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Outlook icon. You should see a message asking if you want to start Outlook in safe mode. Click Yes. If Outlook works fine in safe mode, it means one of the add-ins is causing the problem. To disable add-ins, go to File > Options > Add-ins. In the Manage drop-down list, select COM Add-ins and click Go. Uncheck any add-ins that you don’t need and click OK. Restart Outlook normally and check if the issue is resolved4. Create a new Outlook profile. A profile is a set of settings and information that Outlook uses to manage your email accounts and data. Sometimes, a profile can get corrupted or damaged and cause Outlook to malfunction. To create a new profile, go to Control Panel > Mail > Show Profiles. Click Add and follow the instructions to set up a new profile with your email account. Make sure to select the option to use the new profile as the default one. Restart Outlook and check if the issue is resolved5. Repair your Outlook data files. Data files are files that store your email messages, contacts, calendar events, and other items on your computer. Sometimes, data files can get corrupted or damaged and cause Outlook to malfunction. To repair your data files, you can use a tool called scanpst.exe, which is located in the same folder where Outlook is installed (usually C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16). To use scanpst.exe, close Outlook and locate the tool in the folder. Double-click on it and browse to the location of your data file (usually C:\\Users\\username\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Outlook). Select the file and click Start to begin the scanning and repairing process. When it’s done, restart Outlook and check if the issue is resolved. Run the /resetnavpane command. The navigation pane is the panel on the left side of Outlook that shows your folders and accounts. Sometimes, the navigation pane can get corrupted or damaged and cause Outlook to malfunction. To reset the navigation pane, press Windows key + R to open the Run dialog box, or open the Command Prompt. Type outlook.exe /resetnavpane and hit Enter. This will clear and regenerate the navigation pane settings for Outlook. Restart Outlook and check if the issue is resolved."

      "option_a": "Enterprise",
      "option_b": "Pro for Workstation",
      "option_c": "Home",
      "option_d": "Pro",
      "explanation": "Windows 10 Enterprise is an edition of Windows 10 that is designed for large organizations that need advanced security and management features. Windows 10 Enterprise can be activated using different methods, such as Multiple Activation Key (MAK), Active Directory-based Activation (ADBA), or Key Management Service (KMS)1. KMS is a method of activation that uses a local server to activate multiple devices on a network. KMS activations are valid for 180 days and need to be renewed periodically by connecting to the KMS server2. If a device does not renew its activation within 180 days, it will enter a grace period of 30 days, after which it will display a warning message and lose some functionality until it is reactivated3. The other editions of Windows 10 do not require reactivation every 180 days. Windows 10 Pro for Workstation is an edition of Windows 10 that is designed for high-performance devices that need advanced features such as ReFS file system, persistent memory, and faster file sharing. Windows 10 Pro for Workstation can be activated using a digital license or a product key. Windows 10 Home is an edition of Windows 10 that is designed for personal or home use. Windows 10 Home can be activated using a digital license or a product key. Windows 10 Pro is an edition of Windows 10 that is designed for business or professional use. Windows 10 Pro can be activated using a digital license or a product key.

      "option_b": "Examine the localhost file entries",
      "option_c": "Verify the routing tables",
      "option_d": "Update the antivirus definitions",
      "explanation": "A possible cause of the user being redirected to unexpected websites is that the localhost file entries have been modified by malware or hackers to point to malicious or unwanted websites. The localhost file is a text file that maps hostnames to IP addresses and can override DNS settings. By examining the localhost file entries, a technician can identify and remove any suspicious or unauthorized entries that may cause the redirection issue. Enabling firewall ACLs may not resolve the issue if the firewall rules do not block the malicious or unwanted websites. Verifying the routing tables may not resolve the issue if the routing configuration is correct and does not affect the web traffic. Updating the antivirus definitions may help prevent future infections but may not remove the existing malware or changes to the localhost file.

      "option_c": "Configure port forwarding",
      "option_d": "Change the default credentials",
      "explanation": "One of the most effective ways to defend against malicious actors targeting home routers for DDoS attacks is to change the default credentials of the router. The default credentials are often well-known or easily guessed by attackers, who can then access and compromise the router settings and firmware. By changing the default credentials to strong and unique ones, a technician can prevent unauthorized access and configuration changes to the router. Adding network content filtering may help block some malicious or unwanted websites but may not prevent attackers from exploiting router vulnerabilities or backdoors. Disabling the SSID broadcast may help reduce the visibility of the wireless network but may not prevent attackers from scanning or detecting it. Configuring port forwarding may help direct incoming traffic to specific devices or services but may not prevent attackers from sending malicious packets or requests to the router.

      "explanation": "Risk analysis is used to explain issues that may occur during a change implementation. Risk analysis is a process of identifying, assessing and prioritizing potential risks that may affect a project or an activity. Risk analysis can help determine the likelihood and impact of various issues that may arise during a change implementation, such as technical errors, compatibility problems, security breaches, performance degradation or user dissatisfaction. Risk analysis can also help plan and prepare for mitigating or avoiding these issues. Scope change is a modification of the original goals, requirements or deliverables of a project or an activity. Scope change is not used to explain issues that may occur during a change implementation but to reflect changes in expectations or needs of the stakeholders. End-user acceptance is a measure of how well the users are satisfied with and adopt a new system or service. End-user acceptance is not used to explain issues that may occur during a change implementation but to evaluate the success and effectiveness of the change. Rollback plan is a contingency plan that describes how to restore a system or service to its previous state in case of a failed or problematic change implementation. Rollback plan is not used to explain issues that may occur during a change implementation but to recover from them.

      "option_d": "Get authorization from the manager",
      "explanation": "The next step that the technician should do before taking the computer off site for repair is to get authorization from the manager. Getting authorization from the manager is important because it ensures that the technician has permission and approval to remove the computer from the premises and perform the repair work off site. Getting authorization from the manager can also help document and communicate the reason and duration of the repair and avoid any misunderstanding or conflict with the user or the organization. Removing the HDD and then sending the computer for repair may not be feasible or necessary if the issue is not related to the HDD or if the HDD contains essential data or software for the repair. Checking corporate policies for guidance may be a good step but it does not replace getting authorization from the manager who is responsible for the computer and its data. Deleting the sensitive information before the computer leaves the building may not be possible or advisable if the issue prevents access to the data or if the data is needed for troubleshooting or recovery purposes.

A system restore point is a snapshot of the system settings and configuration at a certain point in time. A System Restore is a feature that allows users to restore their system to a previous state in case of problems or errors. However, a System Restore does not affect personal files or folders, and it may not remove malware that was already present on the system before the restore point was created."

      "option_d": "Digitizer",
      "explanation": "The piece of hardware that the technician should replace to resolve the issue of the screen failing to rotate on a mobile device that was dropped is the accelerometer. The accelerometer is a sensor that detects the orientation and movement of the mobile device by measuring the acceleration forces acting on it. The accelerometer allows the screen to rotate automatically according to the position and angle of the device. If the accelerometer is damaged or malfunctioning, the screen may not rotate properly or at all, even if the settings are correctly applied. LCD stands for Liquid Crystal Display and is a type of display that uses liquid crystals and backlight to produce images on the screen. LCD is not related to the screen rotation feature but to the quality and brightness of the display. Battery is a component that provides power to the mobile device by storing and releasing electrical energy. Battery is not related to the screen rotation feature but to the battery life and performance of the device. Digitizer is a component that converts touch inputs into digital signals that can be processed by the mobile device. Digitizer is not related to the screen rotation feature but to the touch sensitivity and accuracy of the display.

      "option_b": "Invalid certificate",
      "option_c": "Modified file",
      "option_d": "Browser cache",
      "explanation": "The most likely cause of the issue of having different hash values for a downloaded security tool is a modified file. A hash value is a unique and fixed-length string that is generated from an algorithm that processes data or files. A hash value can be used to verify the integrity and authenticity of data or files by comparing it with a known or expected value. If the hash values do not match, it means that the data or file has been altered or corrupted in some way. A modified file may result from intentional or unintentional changes, such as editing, encryption, compression or malware infection. Private-browsing mode is a feature that allows users to browse the web without storing any browsing history, cookies or cache on their browser. Private-browsing mode does not affect the hash value of a downloaded file but only how the browser handles user data. Invalid certificate is an error that occurs when a website or a server does not have a valid or trusted digital certificate that proves its identity and secures its communication. Invalid certificate does not affect the hash value of a downloaded file but only how the browser verifies the website or server’s credibility. Browser cache is a temporary storage that stores copies of web pages, images and other content that users have visited on their browser."

      "option_d": "Configure MFA on the network",
      "explanation": "The first thing that the specialist should do to protect the company’s data on an insecure network with open authentication is to connect to the vendor’s network using a VPN. A VPN stands for Virtual Private Network and is a technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection over a public or untrusted network. A VPN can protect the company’s data by preventing eavesdropping, interception or modification of the network traffic by unauthorized parties. A VPN can also provide access to the company’s internal network and resources remotely. Manually configuring an IP address, a subnet mask and a default gateway may not be necessary or possible if the vendor’s network uses DHCP to assign network configuration parameters automatically. Manually configuring an IP address, a subnet mask and a default gateway does not protect the company’s data from network attacks or threats. Changing the network location to private may not be advisable or effective if the vendor’s network is a public or untrusted network. Changing the network location to private does not protect the company’s data from network attacks or threats. Configuring MFA on the network may not be feasible or sufficient if the vendor’s network has open authentication and does not support or require MFA.

        "explanation": "The most likely cause of the user’s issue of applications opening without being launched and browser redirects when trying to go to certain websites is malware. Malware is a general term that refers to any software or code that is malicious or harmful to a computer or system. Malware can perform various unwanted or unauthorized actions on a computer or system, such as opening applications, redirecting browsers, displaying ads, stealing data, encrypting files or damaging hardware. Malware can infect a computer or system through various means, such as email attachments, web downloads, removable media or network connections. Keylogger is a type of malware that records and transmits the keystrokes made by a user on a keyboard. Keylogger can be used to steal personal or sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers or chat messages. Keylogger does not typically open applications or redirect browsers but only captures user inputs. Cryptominers are a type of malware that use the computing resources of a computer or system to mine cryptocurrencies without the user’s consent or knowledge. Cryptominers do not typically open applications or redirect browsers but only consume CPU or GPU power. Virus is a type of malware that attaches itself to a legitimate program or file and spreads to other programs or files when executed. Virus can cause various symptoms or damages on a computer or system, but it is a subset of malware and not as broad or specific as malware in this context.

The Processes tab displays a list of all the processes that are currently running on the system, along with their CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. The technician can sort the processes by resource usage to pinpoint any that are consuming excessive resources and determine if they are legitimate or unwanted. The Users tab shows the users logged into the system and the resources their processes are using, but it doesn’t provide a detailed breakdown of individual processes. The Performance tab provides an overview of system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, etc.), but it doesn’t list specific processes.

Safe Mode is a diagnostic mode that starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services, allowing the technician to determine if the issue is related to corrupted drivers, software conflicts, or system files. If the PC boots successfully in Safe Mode, the technician can then investigate further (e.g., checking drivers or system files). Rolling back drivers assumes the system can boot normally to access driver settings, which may not be possible. Performing a full system restore or reinstalling the OS are more drastic steps that should be considered only after less invasive troubleshooting, like Safe Mode, fails.

Weak signal (e.g., due to distance or obstacles) is a common cause of intermittent connectivity, easily checked via Wi-Fi settings. Password issues would prevent connection entirely, not cause drops. Network interference and firmware version are secondary considerations after signal strength. Reference: CompTIA A+ Core 2 (220-1002) Certification Exam Objectives Version 4.0, Domain 2.2"
