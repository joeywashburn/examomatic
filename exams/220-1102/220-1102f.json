    "question_number": 518,
    "question": "An administrator needs to select a method to dispose of SSDs containing sensitive data. Which of the following are the most appropriate methods? (Select two).",
    "correct_answer": "C,F",
    "option_a": "Degauss",
    "option_b": "Delete",
    "option_c": "Incinerate",
    "option_d": "Recycle",
    "option_e": "Format",
    "option_f": "Shred",
    "explanation": "Disposing of SSDs with sensitive data requires methods that ensure data is unrecoverable. Incineration (C) destroys the SSD by burning it at high temperatures, making data recovery impossible. Shredding (F) physically breaks the SSD into small pieces, also rendering data irretrievable. Degaussing (A) is ineffective on SSDs as it targets magnetic media, not flash memory. Deleting (B) and Formatting (E) do not securely erase data, as it can be recovered with software. Recycling (D) does not guarantee data destruction unless paired with physical destruction."

    "question_number": 519,
    "question": "A technician is troubleshooting a PC that is unable to perform DNS lookups. Utilizing the following firewall output: Protocol/Port Action Direction 1 Allow Out 445 Block Out 53 Block Out 123 Block Out 80 Block Out. Which of the following ports should be opened to allow for DNS recursion?",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "option_a": "1",
    "option_b": "53",
    "option_c": "80",
    "option_d": "123",
    "option_e": "445",
    "explanation": "DNS lookups rely on port 53 for queries and responses. The firewall output shows port 53 blocked for outgoing traffic, preventing DNS recursion (resolving domain names to IP addresses). Opening port 53 (B) will allow DNS requests to pass. Port 1 (A) is not standard for any service, 445 (E) is for SMB file sharing, 123 (D) is for NTP time synchronization, and 80 (C) is for HTTP web traffic, none of which relate to DNS."

    "question_number": 520,
    "question": "A technician is troubleshooting a smartphone that is unable to download and install the latest OS update. The technician notices the device operates more slowly than expected, even after rebooting and closing all applications. Which of the following should the technician check next?",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "option_a": "Application permissions",
    "option_b": "Available storage space",
    "option_c": "Battery charge level",
    "option_d": "Wi-Fi connection speed",
    "explanation": "Insufficient storage space (B) often prevents OS updates, which require significant free space for downloading and installation. Low storage can also slow device performance due to limited space for temporary files. Application permissions (A) are unrelated to OS updates or speed. Battery level (C) may affect update initiation but not slow operation. Wi-Fi speed (D) impacts download time but is less likely the root cause compared to storage."

    "option_a": "Authenticator application",
    "option_b": "Access control lists",
    "option_c": "Biometrics",
    "option_d": "Smart card readers",
    "explanation": "An authenticator application (A) generates time-sensitive passcodes for two-factor authentication (2FA), adding an extra security layer beyond passwords. Access control lists (B) define permissions, not passcodes. Biometrics (C) uses physical traits for authentication, not passcodes. Smart card readers (D) authenticate via physical cards, not generated codes."

    "option_b": "Inform the user of the investigation",
    "option_c": "Recover and secure the workstation",
    "option_d": "Back up the workstation",
    "explanation": "Recovering and securing the workstation (C) preserves the chain of custody by preventing tampering and maintaining evidence integrity for forensic analysis. Reimaging (A) destroys evidence, informing the user (B) risks alerting potential suspects, and backing up (D) may alter data timestamps, compromising forensic validity."

Which of the following methods is most appropriate for the users?",
    "correct_answer": "D",
    "option_a": "Make office attendance mandatory for one day per week so that updates can be installed",
    "option_b": "Ask users to ensure that they run updates on devices and reboot computers on a regular basis",
    "option_c": "Push updates out via VPN on a weekly basis in a staggered manner so that the network is not affected",
    "option_d": "Configure cloud-based endpoint management software to automatically manage computer updates",
    "explanation": "Cloud-based endpoint management software (D) allows remote, automated updates for dispersed staff, ensuring consistency without user intervention or office visits. Mandatory attendance (A) is impractical, user-managed updates (B) are unreliable, and VPN updates (C) are less efficient than cloud solutions."

    "option_a": "Enable boot logging on the system",
    "option_b": "Launch the last known-good configuration",
    "option_c": "Check the system resource usage in Task Manager",
    "option_d": "Run the sfc /scannow command",
    "option_e": "Use the Event Viewer to open the application log",
    "explanation": "Enabling boot logging (A) creates a log (ntbtlog.txt) of drivers and services loaded during startup, helping identify failures causing OS loading issues. Last known-good configuration (B) is a fix, not a diagnosis. Task Manager (C) requires a running OS, sfc /scannow (D) repairs files but doesn’t diagnose startup, and Event Viewer (E) is less specific for boot issues."

    "option_e": "Clear the application's cache",
    "option_f": "Enable the device's built-in anti-malware protection",
    "explanation": "Uninstalling the game (A) addresses the likely cause of crashes and battery drain, as it started post-download. Installing security patches (D) ensures the device is protected against vulnerabilities exploited by the app. Factory reset (B) is excessive initially, charging (C) doesn’t fix the root issue, clearing cache (E) is insufficient, and anti-malware (F) is a later step."
