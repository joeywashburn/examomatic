      "question_number": 401,
      "question": "A systems administrator is troubleshooting network performance issues in a large corporate office. The end users report that traffic to certain internal environments is not stable and often drops. Which of the following command-line tools can provide the most detailed information for investigating the issue further?",
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "option_a": "ipconfig",
      "option_b": "arp",
      "option_c": "nslookup",
      "option_d": "pathping",
      "explanation": "Pathping is the best command-line tool to provide the most detailed information for investigating the network performance issue further. Pathping is a utility that combines the functions of ping and tracert, which are two other command-line tools that test network connectivity and latency. Pathping sends packets to each router on the path to a destination and then computes results based on the packets returned from each hop. Pathping can show the route taken by the packets, the number of hops, the latency of each hop, and the packet loss percentage. This information can help the systems administrator identify where the network problem occurs and how severe it is. Ipconfig, arp, and nslookup are not as useful as pathping for this task. Ipconfig shows the configuration of the network interface card, such as IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway. Arp shows the mapping of IP addresses to MAC addresses in the local network. Nslookup queries DNS servers for domain name resolution."

      "question_number": 402,
      "question": "Which of the following would allow physical access to a restricted area while maintaining a record of events?",
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "option_a": "Hard token",
      "option_b": "Access control vestibule",
      "option_c": "Key fob",
      "option_d": "Door Lock",
      "explanation": "Access control vestibule is the correct answer for this question. An access control vestibule is a physical security device that consists of two doors that form an enclosed space between them. The first door opens only after verifying the identity of the person entering, such as by using a card reader, biometric scanner, or keypad. The second door opens only after the first door closes, creating a buffer zone that prevents unauthorized access or tailgating. An access control vestibule also maintains a record of events, such as who entered or exited, when, and how. Hard token, key fob, and door lock are not sufficient to meet the requirements of this question. A hard token is a device that generates a one-time password or code for authentication purposes. A key fob is a small device that can be attached to a key ring and used to unlock doors or start vehicles remotely. A door lock is a mechanism that secures a door from opening without a key or a code."

      "question": "A technician is partitioning a hard disk. The five primary partitions should contain 4TB of free space. Which of the following partition styles should the technician use to partition the device?",
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "option_a": "EFS",
      "option_b": "GPT",
      "option_c": "MBR",
      "option_d": "FAT32",
      "explanation": "GPT is the correct answer for this question. GPT stands for GUID Partition Table, and it is a partition style that supports up to 128 primary partitions and up to 18 exabytes of disk size per partition. GPT also uses a unique identifier for each partition and provides better data protection and recovery. GPT is suitable for partitioning a hard disk that has five primary partitions with 4TB of free space each. EFS, MBR, and FAT32 are not correct answers for this question. EFS stands for Encrypting File System, and it is a feature that allows encrypting files and folders on NTFS volumes. EFS is not a partition style, but rather a file system attribute. MBR stands for Master Boot Record, and it is an older partition style that supports up to four primary partitions and up to 2TB of disk size per partition. MBR cannot handle five primary partitions with 4TB of free space each. FAT32 stands for File Allocation Table 32, and it is a file system that supports up to 32GB of disk size per partition and up to 4GB of file size. FAT32 is not a partition style, but rather a file system type."

      "question": "A user is setting up backups on a workstation. The user wants to ensure that the restore process is as simple as possible. Which of the following backup types should the user select?",
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "option_a": "Full",
      "option_b": "Incremental",
      "option_c": "Differential",
      "option_d": "Synthetic",
      "explanation": "Full backup is the best option to ensure that the restore process is as simple as possible. A full backup is a backup type that copies all the data from the source to the destination, regardless of whether the data has changed or not. A full backup provides the most complete and consistent backup of the data, and it allows the user to restore the data from a single backup set without relying on any previous or subsequent backups. Incremental, differential, and synthetic backups are not as simple as full backups for restoring data. An incremental backup is a backup type that copies only the data that has changed since the last backup, whether it was full or incremental. An incremental backup requires less time and space than a full backup, but it also requires multiple backup sets to restore the data completely. A differential backup is a backup type that copies only the data that has changed since the last full backup. A differential backup requires more time and space than an incremental backup, but it also requires fewer backup sets to restore the data than an incremental backup. A synthetic backup is a backup type that combines a full backup with one or more incremental or differential backups to create a consolidated backup set. A synthetic backup requires less time and bandwidth than a full backup, but it also requires more processing power and storage space than an incremental or differential backup."

      "question": "A computer technician is investigating a computer that is not booting. The user reports that the computer was working prior to shutting it down last night. The technician notices a removable USB device is inserted, and the user explains the device is a prize the user received in the mail yesterday. Which of the following types of attacks does this describe?",
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "option_a": "Phishing",
      "option_b": "Dumpster diving",
      "option_c": "Tailgating",
      "option_d": "Evil twin",
      "explanation": "Phishing is the correct answer for this question. Phishing is a type of attack that uses fraudulent emails or other messages to trick users into revealing sensitive information or installing malicious software. Phishing emails often impersonate legitimate entities or individuals and offer incentives or threats to lure users into clicking on malicious links or attachments. In this scenario, the user received a removable USB device in the mail as a prize, which could be a phishing attempt to infect the user’s computer with malware or gain access to the user’s data. Dumpster diving, tailgating, and evil twin are not correct answers for this question. Dumpster diving is a type of attack that involves searching through trash bins or recycling containers to find discarded documents or devices that contain valuable information. Tailgating is a type of attack that involves following an authorized person into a restricted area without proper identification or authorization. Evil twin is a type of attack that involves setting up a rogue wireless access point that mimics a legitimate one to intercept or manipulate network traffic."

      "question": "An engineer is configuring a new server that requires a bare-metal installation. Which of the following installation methods should the engineer use if installation media is not available on site?",
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "option_a": "Image deployment",
      "option_b": "Recovery partition installation",
      "option_c": "Remote network installation",
      "option_d": "Repair installation",
      "explanation": "Remote network installation is the best option for configuring a new server that requires a bare-metal installation without installation media on site. A remote network installation is a method of installing an operating system or an application over a network connection, such as LAN, WAN, or Internet. A remote network installation can use various protocols, such as PXE, HTTP, FTP, or SMB, to access the installation files from a server or a cloud service. A remote network installation can also use various tools, such as Windows Deployment Services, Microsoft Deployment Toolkit, or Red Hat Kickstart, to automate and customize the installation process. A remote network installation can save time and resources by eliminating the need for physical media and allowing centralized management of multiple installations. Image deployment, recovery partition installation, and repair installation are not correct answers for this question. Image deployment is a method of installing an operating system or an application by copying a preconfigured image file to a target device. Image deployment requires an existing image file and a compatible device. Recovery partition installation is a method of restoring an operating system or an application from a hidden partition on the hard disk that contains the original factory settings. Recovery partition installation requires an existing recovery partition and a functional hard disk. Repair installation is a method of fixing an operating system or an application that is corrupted or damaged by replacing or repairing the system files without affecting the user data or settings. Repair installation requires an existing operating system or application and a working device."

      "question": "A technician needs administrator access on a Windows workstation to facilitate system changes without elevating permissions. Which of the following would best accomplish this task?",
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "option_a": "Group Policy Editor",
      "option_b": "Local Users and Groups",
      "option_c": "Device Manager",
      "option_d": "System Configuration",
      "explanation": "Local Users and Groups is the best option to accomplish this task. Local Users and Groups is a tool that allows managing the local user accounts and groups on a Windows workstation. The technician can use this tool to create a new user account with administrator privileges or add an existing user account to the Administrators group. This way, the technician can log in with the administrator account and make system changes without elevating permissions. Group Policy Editor, Device Manager, and System Configuration are not correct answers for this question. Group Policy Editor is a tool that allows configuring policies and settings for users and computers in a domain environment. Device Manager is a tool that allows managing the hardware devices and drivers on a Windows workstation. System Configuration is a tool that allows modifying the startup options and services on a Windows workstation. None of these tools can directly grant administrator access to a user account."

      "question": "A technician receives an invalid certificate error when visiting a website. Other workstations on the same local network are unable to replicate this issue. Which of the following is most likely causing the issue?",
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "option_a": "Date and time",
      "option_b": "User access control",
      "option_c": "UEFI boot mode",
      "option_d": "Log-on times",
      "explanation": "Date and time is the most likely cause of the issue. The date and time settings on a workstation affect the validity of the certificates used by websites to establish secure connections. If the date and time are incorrect, the workstation may not recognize the certificate as valid and display an invalid certificate error. Other workstations on the same local network may not have this issue if their date and time are correct. User access control, UEFI boot mode, and log-on times are not likely causes of the issue. User access control is a feature that prevents unauthorized changes to the system by prompting for confirmation or credentials. UEFI boot mode is a firmware interface that controls the boot process of the workstation. Log-on times are settings that restrict when a user can log in to the workstation. None of these factors affect the validity of the certificates used by websites."

      "question": "A company is recycling old hard drives and wants to quickly reprovision the drives for reuse. Which of the following data destruction methods should the company use?",
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "option_a": "Degaussing",
      "option_b": "Standard formatting",
      "option_c": "Low-level wiping",
      "option_d": "Deleting",
      "explanation": "Low-level wiping is the best data destruction method for recycling old hard drives for reuse. Low-level wiping is a process that overwrites every bit of data on a hard drive with zeros or random patterns, making it impossible to recover any data from the drive. Low-level wiping also restores the drive to its factory state, removing any bad sectors or errors that may have accumulated over time. Low-level wiping can be done using specialized software tools or hardware devices that connect to the drive. Degaussing, standard formatting, and deleting are not suitable data destruction methods for recycling old hard drives for reuse. Degaussing is a process that exposes a hard drive to a strong magnetic field, destroying both the data and the drive itself. Degaussing renders the drive unusable for reuse. Standard formatting is a process that erases the data on a hard drive by removing the file system structure, but it does not overwrite the data itself. Standard formatting leaves some data recoverable using forensic tools or software utilities. Deleting is a process that removes the data from a hard drive by marking it as free space, but it does not erase or overwrite the data itself. Deleting leaves most data recoverable using undelete tools or software utilities."

      "question_number": 410,
      "question": "Which of the following is used to ensure users have the appropriate level of access to perform their job functions?",
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "option_a": "Access control list",
      "option_b": "Multifactor authentication",
      "option_c": "Least privilege",
      "option_d": "Mobile device management",
      "explanation": "Least privilege is the principle that is used to ensure users have the appropriate level of access to perform their job functions. Least privilege means granting users only the minimum amount of access rights and permissions they need to perform their tasks, and nothing more. Least privilege reduces the risk of unauthorized access, data leakage, malware infection, or accidental damage by limiting what users can do on the system or network. Access control list, multifactor authentication, and mobile device management are not principles, but rather mechanisms or methods that can implement least privilege. Access control list is a list that specifies the users or groups that are allowed or denied access to a resource, such as a file, folder, or printer. Multifactor authentication is a method that requires users to provide two or more pieces of evidence to prove their identity, such as a password, a token, or a biometric factor. Mobile device management is a tool that allows managing and securing mobile devices, such as smartphones or tablets, that are used by employees to access corporate data or applications."

      "option_b": "-s",
      "option_c": "-lh",
      "option_d": "-t",
      "explanation": "The -a option is used to display hidden files and directories in a command-line interface. Hidden files and directories are those that start with a dot (.) and are normally not shown by default. The -a option stands for “all” and shows all files and directories, including the hidden ones. The -a option can be used with commands such as ls, dir, or find to list or search for hidden files and directories. The -s, -lh, and -t options are not used to display hidden files and directories. The -s option stands for “size” and shows the size of files or directories in bytes. The -lh option stands for “long human-readable” and shows the size of files or directories in a more readable format, such as KB, MB, or GB. The -t option stands for “time” and sorts the files or directories by modification time."

      "option_a": ".bat",
      "option_b": ".dll",
      "option_c": ".ps1",
      "option_d": ".txt",
      "explanation": "The .bat file type would be used in the Windows Startup folder to automate copying a personal storage table (.pst) file to a network drive at log-in. A .bat file is a batch file that contains a series of commands that can be executed by the command interpreter. A .bat file can be used to perform various tasks, such as copying, moving, deleting, or renaming files or directories. A .bat file can be placed in the Windows Startup folder to run automatically when a user logs in to the system. A .bat file can use the copy command to copy a .pst file from a local drive to a network drive. A .pst file is a personal storage table file that contains email messages, contacts, calendars, and other data from Microsoft Outlook. A .pst file can be backed up to a network drive for security or recovery purposes. The .dll, .ps1, and .txt file types are not used in the Windows Startup folder to automate copying a .pst file to a network drive at log-in. A .dll file is a dynamic link library file that contains code or data that can be shared by multiple programs. A .dll file cannot be executed directly by the user or the system. A .ps1 file is a PowerShell script file that contains commands or expressions that can be executed by the PowerShell interpreter. A .ps1 file can also perform various tasks, such as copying files or directories, but it requires PowerShell to be installed and configured on the system.

      "question": "A systems administrator received a request to limit the amount of cellular data a user's Windows 10 tablet can utilize when traveling. Which of the following can the administrator do to best solve the user's issue?",
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "option_a": "Turn on airplane mode",
      "option_b": "Set the connection to be metered",
      "option_c": "Configure the device to use a static IP address",
      "option_d": "Enable the Windows Defender Firewall",
      "explanation": "Setting the connection to be metered is the best solution for limiting the amount of cellular data a user’s Windows 10 tablet can utilize when traveling. A metered connection is a network connection that has a data limit or charges fees based on the amount of data used. Windows 10 allows users to set any network connection as metered, which reduces the amount of data that Windows and some apps use in the background. For example, setting a connection as metered will prevent Windows from downloading updates automatically, stop some apps from syncing data online, and disable some live tiles on the Start menu. Setting a connection as metered can help users save cellular data and avoid extra charges when traveling. Turning on airplane mode, configuring the device to use a static IP address, and enabling the Windows Defender Firewall are not effective solutions for limiting the amount of cellular data a user’s Windows 10 tablet can utilize when traveling. Turning on airplane mode will disable all wireless connections on the device, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular data. This will prevent the user from accessing any online services or applications on the tablet. Configuring the device to use a static IP address will assign a fixed IP address to the device instead of obtaining one dynamically from a DHCP server. This will not affect the amount of cellular data the device uses, and it may cause IP conflicts or connectivity issues on some networks. Enabling the Windows Defender Firewall will block or allow incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined or custom rules. This will not reduce the amount of cellular data the device uses, and it may interfere with some apps or services that require network access."

      "option_b": "Quarantine the host in the antivirus system",
      "option_c": "Investigate how the system was infected with malware",
      "option_d": "Create a system restore point",
      "explanation": "Educating the end user on best practices for security is the next step that the technician should take after successfully removing malicious software from an infected computer. Educating the end user on best practices for security is an important part of preventing future infections and mitigating risks. The technician should explain to the end user how to avoid common sources of malware, such as phishing emails, malicious websites, or removable media. The technician should also advise the end user to use strong passwords, update software regularly, enable antivirus and firewall protection, and backup data frequently. Educating the end user on best practices for security can help the end user become more aware and responsible for their own security and reduce the likelihood of recurrence of malware infections. Quarantining the host in the antivirus system, investigating how the system was infected with malware, and creating a system restore point are not the next steps that the technician should take after successfully removing malicious software from an infected computer. Quarantining the host in the antivirus system is a step that the technician should take before removing malicious software from an infected computer. Quarantining the host in the antivirus system means isolating the infected computer from the network or other devices to prevent the spread of malware. Investigating how the system was infected with malware is a step that the technician should take during or after removing malicious software from an infected computer. Investigating how the system was infected with malware means identifying the source, type, and impact of malware on the system and documenting the findings and actions taken. Creating a system restore point is a step that the technician should take before removing malicious software from an infected computer. Creating a system restore point means saving a snapshot of the system’s configuration and settings at a certain point in time, which can be used to restore the system in case of failure or corruption."

      "question": "A technician is troubleshooting a computer that fails to boot and displays a 'No OS found' error. Which of the following should the technician check first?",
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "option_a": "RAM modules",
      "option_b": "Boot order in BIOS",
      "option_c": "Power supply voltage",
      "option_d": "CPU fan",
      "explanation": "The technician should first check the boot order in the BIOS. A 'No OS found' error typically indicates that the system cannot locate an operating system, often because the boot device (e.g., hard drive or SSD) is not set as the first priority in the BIOS boot sequence. Checking this is a quick and logical first step before investigating hardware issues like RAM, power supply, or CPU fan."

      "question": "Which of the following is an example of a physical security control?",
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "option_a": "Firewall",
      "option_b": "Antivirus software",
      "option_c": "Biometric scanner",
      "option_d": "Encryption",
      "explanation": "A biometric scanner is an example of a physical security control, as it restricts physical access to a facility or device by verifying a person’s unique biological traits (e.g., fingerprint, retina). Firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption are logical security controls focused on protecting data and systems, not physical access."
