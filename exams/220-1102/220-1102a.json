      "question_number": 1,
      "question": "A technician installed a known-good, compatible motherboard on a new laptop. However, the motherboard is not working on the laptop. Which of the following should the technician MOST likely have done to prevent damage?",
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "option_a": "Removed all jewelry",
      "option_b": "Completed an inventory of tools before use",
      "option_c": "Practiced electrical fire safety",
      "option_d": "Connected a proper ESD strap",
      "explanation": "The technician should have connected a proper ESD strap to prevent damage to the motherboard. ESD (electrostatic discharge) can cause damage to electronic components, and an ESD strap helps to prevent this by grounding the technician and preventing the buildup of static electricity. Removing all jewelry is also a good practice, but it is not the most likely solution to this problem."

      "option_b": "Host address",
      "option_c": "Name server",
      "option_d": "Subnet mask",
      "explanation": "The technician most likely needs to change the default gateway on the workstation to resolve the issue. The default gateway is the IP address of the router that connects the workstation to the internet, and it is responsible for routing traffic between the workstation and the internet. If the default gateway is incorrect, the workstation will not be able to access external web pages."

      "question_number": 3,
      "question": "A technician needs to recommend the best backup method that will mitigate ransomware attacks. Only a few files are regularly modified, however, storage space is a concern. Which of the following backup methods would BEST address these concerns?",
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "option_a": "Full",
      "option_b": "Differential",
      "option_c": "Off-site",
      "option_d": "Grandfather-father-son",
      "explanation": "The differential backup method would best address these concerns. Differential backups only back up files that have changed since the last full backup, which means that only a few files would be backed up each time. This would help to mitigate the risk of ransomware attacks, as only a few files would be affected if an attack occurred. Additionally, differential backups require less storage space than full backups."

      "option_a": "Have the user provide a callback phone number to be added to the ticket",
      "option_b": "Assign the ticket to the department's power user",
      "option_c": "Register the ticket with a unique user identifier",
      "option_d": "Provide the user with a unique ticket number that can be referenced on subsequent calls",
      "explanation": "The technician should provide the user with a unique ticket number that can be referenced on subsequent calls to make sure the ticket is associated with the correct user. This is because registering the ticket with a unique user identifier, having the user provide a callback phone number to be added to the ticket, or assigning the ticket to the department’s power user will not ensure that the ticket is associated with the correct user."
